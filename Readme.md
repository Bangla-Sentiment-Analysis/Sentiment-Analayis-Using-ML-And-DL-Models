# ML and DL Approaches for Bangla Sentiment Classification Across Diverse Emotion Labels

In this paper, we implemented and evaluated a total of eight models for Bangla text sentiment analysis. Specifically, we applied four machine learning models—Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression—alongside four deep learning models, including a CNN with additional regularization, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU), and a fine-tuned CNN model. The experiments were conducted on two datasets: one labeled with 6 emotion categories and another with 7 emotion categories. Our objective was to compare the performance of these models in multiclass emotion classification and identify the most effective approach for Bangla sentiment analysis.
